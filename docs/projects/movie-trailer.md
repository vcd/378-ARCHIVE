# Movie Trailer

> Videos on Internet for decades. Yet, `video` HTML element is still relatively new.

## Why Does This Project Exist? 

Support for native video (and audio) is still inconsistent across browser. JavaScript is required to provide hooks for styling, and consistency of playback across browser. Also, responsive design of video is very cumbersome. This is why YouTube, Vimeo, Daily Motion, etc. embeds are very popular and easy-to-use. 

The downsides of this ease-of-use are: 

* UI (user interface) does not match website or content
* YouTube and others show advertisements
* Use of `object`, `embeds`, and Flash (no mobile support)

Videos have been apart the Web for decades. Yet, support for native video (and audio) are still inconsistent across browser, the [`video` element specification is still in a work in progress](https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110113/video.html#video), and requires JavaScript to provide hooks for styling.  Also, responsive design of videos is very cumbersome. This is why YouTube, Vimeo, Daily Motion, etc. embeds are very popular and easy-to-use. 

The downsides of this ease-of-use are: 
* UI (user interface) does not match website or content
* YouTube and others show advertisements
* Use of `object`, `embeds`, and Flash (no mobile support)

The benefits of using HTML, CSS, and JS we can: 
* Create a video UI that matches the brand
* Avoid advertisements, tracking, and suggested videos
* Finally. Use `video` element.
