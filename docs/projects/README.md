# Google Doodle

> Animations are: interaction, emotion, and story.

## Overview
Why does this project exist? Aaron Walterâ€™s book (a must read), [Designing for Emotion][1] shows the importance and impact of designing for _any emotion_. At MailChimp, his team at [MailChimp][2] successfully made creating and sending email newsletters - fun. Google does the same on their homepage. Their Google Doodles can be: fun, insightful, intelligent, enigmatic, or just weird, but the all have emotion.
