# SVG

> Spoiler: SVGs are made up of code. 

## Overview

From [SVG: A Practical Guide](https://svgontheweb.com/):

"Scalable Vector Graphics are an XML based markup that can contain two-dimensional vectors. The vectors can be simple shapes, paths, or well just about anything you can do in Illustrator. Itâ€™s an image format that has more in common with a web page that it does with a JPEG. SVG is much more powerful than other image formats we can use on the web as we can manipulate them with code (either in our text editor or with CSS / JS)."

* Resolution independent
* Supported by all modern browsers
* Future-proof (W3C standard)
* Easy to make and edit
* Manipulatable with CSS & JS
* Highly compressible
